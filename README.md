==========

A simplified boardgamegeek.com experience.

I'll probbaly hack some jquery spaghetti and get some proofs of concept working first. Then I'll step back and built it right in Ember. 

A work in progress...

Current todo list:
1. boardgame details page
2. collection details page
3. Top 100 [with filters]

All pages are optimized for mobile.
